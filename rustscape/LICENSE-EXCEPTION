AGPLv3 Network Interaction Exception

As a special exception to the GNU Affero General Public License version 3
("AGPLv3"), you are not required to comply with the requirements of Section 13
of the AGPLv3 to provide Corresponding Source to users who interact with a larger
system that incorporates the Program, provided that all of the following
conditions are met:

1. The Program is used as a component within a larger application or service,
   and is not itself intentionally offered or exposed as a standalone or
   general-purpose network service to third parties; and

2. End users do not intentionally interact with the Program directly, but only
   with the larger application or service, which may process, transform, or
   incorporate data obtained from the Program before presenting results to
   those users; and

3. The Program is not deliberately marketed, documented, or provided as a
   hosted API or service intended for direct use by third parties.

For the avoidance of doubt, interaction by end users with a system that makes
use of the Program solely through indirect backend calls, internal APIs, or
intermediate processing layers shall not be considered interaction with the
Program for the purposes of Section 13 of the AGPLv3 under this exception.

This exception does not apply if the Program is intentionally deployed or
offered in a manner that allows third parties to directly access or use the
Program as a network-accessible service.

This exception grants additional permissions beyond those provided by the
AGPLv3. All other terms and conditions of the AGPLv3 remain fully applicable.
